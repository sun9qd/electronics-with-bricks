|![MicroUsbPowerSupply](img/Brick_MicroUsbPowerSupply.jpg)|**MicroUSB power supply**: The power source is powered by a USB charger via a MicroUSB cable and provides 5V DC voltage. The building block contains a MicroUSB socket, loops out the 5 volt USB power supply and makes it available on its connection pins.|
|![Voltmeter](img/Brick_Voltmeter.jpg)|**Voltmeter**: This building block contains a measuring device for measuring electrical voltages. It is usually powered via a MicroUSB cable. A separate USB charger should preferably be used to ensure that there is no potential in relation to the circuit being measured.|
|![Resistor](img/Brick_Resistor.jpg)|**Resistor**: Electrical resistors are available with different resistance values, which are indicated on the component using colored rings. In the picture, a resistor with 4.7 kOhm.|
|![LED](img/Brick_LED.jpg)|**Light-emitting diode (LED)**: In the picture, a red light-emitting diode that can produce red light. Other light-emitting diodes are green, yellow or other colors. Light-emitting diodes are polarized components that must be connected the right way round.|
|![SignalWire](img/Brick_SignalWire.jpg)|**(Signal) line**: Works like a piece of wire and connects electrically from one side to the other. The red line blocks are used in the general case and as signal lines.|
|![VccWire](img/Brick_VccWire.jpg)|**Vcc line**: The yellow line blocks are used to lay the supply voltage|
|![GroundWire](img/Brick_GroundWire.jpg)|**Ground line**: The green line blocks are used to lay ground|
|![Switch](img/Brick_Switch.jpg)|**Switch**: Switching an electrical connection on and off|
|![npnTransistor](img/Brick_NpnTransistor.jpg)|**Universal transistor NPN type**: Semiconductor component for use as an amplifier and as an electronic switch.|
|![pnpTransistor](img/Brick_PnpTransistor.jpg)|**Universal transistor PNP type**: Semiconductor component for use as an amplifier and as an electronic switch.|
|![Elko](img/Brick_Elko.jpg)|**Electrolytic capacitor**: Capacitor with high capacity but slow reaction speed.|
|![Ceramic capacitor](img/Brick_Kerko.jpg)|**Ceramic capacitor**: Capacitor with low capacity but high reaction speed.|
|![Potentiometer](img/Brick_Potentiometer.jpg)|**Potentiometer**: A variable resistor (the component in the picture is still missing the label).|
|![Crossing diagonally](img/Brick_CrossingDiag.jpg)|**Crossing diagonally**: This component allows two lines to be crossed without them being in contact with each other.|
|![Crossing](img/Brick_Crossing.jpg)|**Crossing**: A second crossing component for crossing two lines that are not in contact with each other.|
|![Buzzer](img/Brick_Buzzer.jpg)|**Buzzer**: This component produces a beeping sound when voltage is applied.|
|![Raspberry Pico](img/Brick_RaspberryPico.jpg)|**Raspberry Pico**: A microcontroller board that is typically programmed from a PC via USB using a separate app with Python. There is a compatible version of the board with WiFi support that can alternatively be fitted into this component.|
|![D1 mini](img/Brick_D1mini.jpg)|**D1 mini**: A microcontroller board with WiFi support that is typically programmed from a PC using the Arduino development environment in C++.|
